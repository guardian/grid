# Provisioning

We use [Packer](https://packer.io) to provision our AMIs. You will need this to
update the AMIs.

You will need your AWS credentials setup inline with the [AWS CLI Settings and
precedence](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#config-settings-and-precedence)

Once you have made the changes to
[provisioning.json](./media-service/provisioning.json) you will need
to run:

    cd packer/media-service  # or imgops
    packer build provisioning.json

You will then be told something like:

    ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
    --> media-service_ebd-storage-cfn: AMIs were created:

    eu-west-1: ami-cae55ebd

Use the AMI ID â¤´ in the
[CloudFormation script](../cloud-formation/media-service.json) where
applicable.


## Deregistering past AMIs

If you have provisioned a new AMI, be sure to clear up your mess and
[deregister your previous one](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Images:sort=name)
and [delete its snapshot](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Snapshots:sort=snapshotId)
