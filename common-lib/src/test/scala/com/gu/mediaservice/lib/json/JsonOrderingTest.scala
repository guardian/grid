    * This is helpful for debugging and for the super-power-users that look at the API as it means that related fields
    * are grouped together throughout our API.
    * This test (which fails with play-json 2.6.14 is here to prevent a further regression. It does mean that we'll
    * need to jump to Play 2.8 for our next upgrade (which is likely to be what we do anyway...)
