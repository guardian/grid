# DEV Setup

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- sbt
- Java 8
- node
- nginx
- Docker
- [GD](http://libgd.github.io/)
- GraphicsMagick with `little-cms2`
- ImageMagick
- pngquant
- [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
- [md5Sum](http://www.ahwkong.com/post/2011/06/07/p-6255384955/)
- [dev-nginx](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx)

If you're a homebrew user, you can install these with:

```bash
brew bundle
```


## AWS Credentials

The Grid requires AWS credentials when running locally to access the resources created by the
[dev CloudFormation stack](./01-cloudformation.md). The credentials should be stored under a
[profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html) named
`media-service`.

Developers working at the Guardian can get these credentials from Janus.

## Client side dependencies
Client side dependencies can be installed by running:

```bash
cd kahuna
npm install
```

## NGINX
To run correctly in standalone mode we run each micro-service behind an nginx site.

Use [nginx-mappings.yml](../nginx-mappings.yml) along with `dev-nginx` to generate the nginx configs.

```bash
dev-nginx setup-app nginx-mappings.yml
```

### NGINX, Play & SNI
As the Play Framework does not yet support [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)
 NGINX can't always work out which certificate to send where when there are multiple services on the same IP.
 This might result in NGINX sending the incorrect certificate resulting in a `HostnameVerifier Exception`.

#### Resolution

When the correct cert to send is ambiguous, NGINX simply sends the first cert it sees in it's configuration,
which is loaded from config files in alphabetical order.

To resolve this problem, prefix your grid config filename with `0-`.
