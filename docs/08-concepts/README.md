# Grid concepts

This section of documentation is designed to act as a collection of descriptions of various concepts in the Grid.
Discussion of implementation is intentionally kept to a minimum, as implementation of these concepts may change over
time, while hopefully the ideas behind these concepts will last for a longer period of time.
