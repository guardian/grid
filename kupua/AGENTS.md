## What is Kupua?

Kupua is a **new React-based frontend** for [Grid](https://github.com/guardian/grid), the Guardian's image DAM (Digital Asset Management) system. It replaces the existing **kahuna** frontend (AngularJS 1.8).

Grid manages ~9 million images stored in S3, with metadata indexed in **Elasticsearch 8.x**. Kupua lives inside the Grid monorepo at `kupua/`.

## Full Migration Plan

📄 **Read the full plan:** `kupua/exploration/docs/migration-plan.md`

It contains:
- Phased migration plan (Phase 1–6)
- Complete kahuna feature inventory with migration status
- Data model reference (ES mapping fields)
- Architecture diagram

📄 **Deviations log:** `kupua/exploration/docs/deviations.md`

Documents intentional differences from Grid/kahuna behaviour and places
where library conventions were bent.  Update it when a new deviation is
introduced.

## Current Phase: Phase 1 — Read-Only with Sample Data

**Goal:** Prove the tech stack works. Load real data into local ES, display it in a fast table view with search and filtering. No writes, no auth, no production systems.

### What's Done

**Infrastructure & data:**
- ✅ Sample data (10k docs, 115MB) from CODE ES in `exploration/mock/sample-data.ndjson` (NOT in git — also in `s3://<sample-data-backup-bucket>/`)
- ✅ ES mapping from CODE in `exploration/mock/mapping.json`
- ✅ Standalone ES 8.18.3 via `docker-compose.yml` on **port 9220** (isolated from Grid's ES on 9200)
- ✅ `scripts/load-sample-data.sh` — index creation + bulk load
- ✅ `scripts/start.sh` — one-command startup (ES + data + deps + Vite). Flags: `--skip-es`, `--skip-data`, `--skip-install`
- ✅ Migration plan: `exploration/docs/migration-plan.md`
- ✅ Mock Grid config: `exploration/mock/grid-config.conf` (sanitised PROD copy, parsed by `src/lib/grid-config.ts` for field aliases + categories)

**App scaffold (~4700 lines of source):**
- ✅ Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4, dev server on port 3000
- ✅ Vite proxy: `/es/*` → `localhost:9220` (no CORS needed)
- ✅ Path alias: `@/*` → `src/*` (in both `tsconfig.json` paths and Vite `resolve.alias`)
- ✅ Grid colour palette in `index.css` as Tailwind `@theme` tokens (e.g. `bg-grid-bg`, `text-grid-accent`)
- ✅ Open Sans self-hosted from `public/fonts/` (same woff2 files as kahuna, not CDN); `--font-sans` overridden in `@theme` so all elements inherit it automatically
- ✅ Shared CSS component classes (`popup-menu`, `popup-item`) in `index.css` `@layer components` for consistent dropdown/context menu styling
- ✅ Three standardised font sizes: `text-xs` (12px, all UI chrome), `text-sm` (14px, table body cells), 13px (CQL input Web Component)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles clean (one pre-existing `@guardian/cql` type issue in `customElements.define` — upstream bug)

**Data Access Layer (DAL):**
- ✅ `ImageDataSource` interface (`dal/types.ts`) — `search()`, `getAggregation()`
- ✅ `ElasticsearchDataSource` adapter (`dal/es-adapter.ts`) — queries ES via Vite proxy, handles sort aliases, CQL→ES translation

**State management:**
- ✅ `search-store.ts` — Zustand store for search params, results, `loadMore()`
- ✅ `column-store.ts` — Zustand + localStorage persist for column visibility, widths, and session-only pre-double-click widths
- ✅ URL is single source of truth — `useUrlSearchSync` hook syncs URL → Zustand → search; `useUpdateSearchParams` hook lets components update URL. Browser back/forward works.
- ✅ Custom URL serialisation in `router.ts` — uses `URLSearchParams` directly (not TanStack Router's `parseSearchWith`/`qss`), keeping all values as plain strings. Colons kept human-readable. See deviations.md §1 for rationale.

**CQL search:**
- ✅ `@guardian/cql` parser + custom CQL→ES translator in `src/lib/cql.ts`
- ✅ `<cql-input>` Web Component for chip rendering, editing, keyboard nav, typeahead — wrapped by `CqlSearchInput.tsx`
- ✅ `LazyTypeahead` (`lazy-typeahead.ts`) — subclass of `@guardian/cql`'s `Typeahead` that decouples key suggestions from value resolution. Prevents the popover from stalling when a slow value resolver is in flight. See deviations.md §12.
- ✅ Typeahead fields built from DAL (`typeahead-fields.ts`) with resolvers using local ES aggregations (terms aggs on keyword fields). Fields without keyword mappings (byline, city, etc.) have no value suggestions — same as kahuna.
- ✅ CQL structural noise filtering — `SearchBar` ignores `queryStr` values that are pure CQL structure (e.g. bare `":"` from empty chips when pressing `+`), preventing spurious searches. Kahuna handles this via its structured query pipeline; kupua filters at the `handleQueryChange` level.
- ✅ Supports structured queries: `credit:"Getty" -by:"Foo" cats fileType:jpeg`
- ✅ `fileType:jpeg` → `source.mimeType` match with MIME conversion (matching Scala `FileTypeMatch`)
- ✅ `is:GNM-owned` — recognized but requires org config from Grid (mocked for now)

**Table view (`ImageTable.tsx`, ~1190 lines):**
- ✅ TanStack Table with virtualised rows (TanStack Virtual), column resizing
- ✅ 17 columns: Category, Image type, Title, Description, Special instructions, By, Credit, Copyright, Source, Taken on, Uploaded, Last modified, Uploader, Filename, Width, Height, File type (Sentence case headers matching CQL keys)
- ✅ Sort on any keyword/date/numeric column by clicking header. Text-only fields (Title, Description, etc.) not sortable (no `.keyword` sub-field). Single click is delayed 250ms to distinguish from double-click.
- ✅ Secondary sort via shift-click (encoded as comma-separated `orderBy` URL param)
- ✅ Sort alias system — `buildSortClause` expands aliases per-part (e.g. `taken` → `metadata.dateTaken,-uploadTime`)
- ✅ Auto-reveal hidden columns when sorted — if the user sorts by a column that's currently hidden (e.g. Last modified, Width), it's automatically shown and persisted to the store as if toggled manually. Generic — works for any sortable hidden column.
- ✅ Click-to-search — shift-click cell to append `key:value` to query; alt-click to exclude. Supported on all text/keyword columns: imageType, title, description, specialInstructions, byline, credit, copyright, source, uploader, filename, fileType, category. Date columns intentionally excluded — exact ISO timestamp searches aren't useful.
- ✅ Accessibility — ARIA roles on table (`role="grid"`, `role="row"`, `role="columnheader"` with `aria-sort`, `role="gridcell"`), context menu (`role="menu"`, `role="menuitemcheckbox"`), sort dropdown (`role="listbox"`, `role="option"`), resize handles (`role="separator"`), loading indicator (`aria-live`), result count (`role="status"`), toolbar (`role="toolbar"`), search landmark (`role="search"`). All zero-performance-cost — HTML attributes only.
- ✅ Cell tooltips via `title` attribute
- ✅ Column visibility — right-click header for context menu. Default hidden: Last modified, Width, Height, File type. Persisted to localStorage.
- ✅ Column widths persisted to localStorage via `column-store.ts` — manual drag resizes and auto-fit widths both persist. Restored on reload.
- ✅ Double-click header to auto-fit — first double-click measures the widest cell value and fits the column. Second double-click restores the previous width. Pre-fit widths are stored in the column store (session-only, not persisted to localStorage). Manual drag-resize clears the saved pre-fit width.
- ✅ Column context menu — right-click any header cell: "Resize column to fit data", "Resize all columns to fit data", separator, then column visibility toggles. Menu uses shared `popup-menu`/`popup-item` classes. Auto-clamps to viewport bounds (never renders off-screen). Right-clicking a specific column shows the single-column resize option; right-clicking the trailing spacer shows only "Resize all" + visibility.
- ✅ Auto-resize to fit — measures the widest cell value across all loaded results using an off-screen `<canvas>` for text measurement (`measureText`), accounts for header label width, padding (16px sides), and sort arrow space.
- ✅ CSS-variable column widths — instead of per-cell `getSize()` calls (~300+/render), a single `<style>` tag injects `--col-<id>` CSS custom properties on `[data-table-root]`. Header and body cells use `width: var(--col-<id>)`. Width changes during resize only touch the style string — no per-cell JS.
- ✅ Memoised table body during resize — `TableBody` is a `React.memo` component. During column resize drags, rows and virtualItems are cached in refs (frozen while `columnSizingInfo.isResizingColumn` is truthy) so the memo's props stay stable and the body skips re-rendering entirely. Column widths update via CSS variables without React involvement. Avoids the bug in TanStack's official performant example (#6121).
- ✅ Column resize with auto-scroll — dragging a resize handle near/past the scroll container edges auto-scrolls the table horizontally (speed proportional to distance past edge, up to 20px/frame). Synthetic `mousemove` events with scroll-adjusted `clientX` keep TanStack Table resizing the column as the container scrolls. On release, a synthetic `mouseup` with the adjusted position finalises the width correctly (the real `mouseup` with unadjusted `clientX` is blocked via capture-phase listener).
- ✅ Horizontal scroll — inner wrapper is `inline-block min-w-full`, header is `inline-flex` with `shrink-0` cells (the browser determines the scrollable width from rendered content — no JS-computed width, correct at any browser zoom level). A 32px trailing spacer after the last header cell ensures the last column's resize handle is always accessible. Root layout uses `w-screen overflow-hidden` to prevent the page from expanding beyond the viewport.
- ✅ Scroll reset on new search — both scrollTop and scrollLeft reset to 0 when URL search params change (new query, sort, filters, logo click). loadMore doesn't change URL params, so infinite scroll is unaffected.

**Toolbar (`SearchBar.tsx` + `SearchFilters.tsx`):**
- ✅ Single-row layout: `[Logo] [Search] [count] | [Free to use] [Dates] | [Sort ↓]`
- ✅ Logo click navigates to `/?nonFree=true` (resets all state), resets scroll position, and focuses the search box
- ✅ Sort dropdown — custom button + popup menu (not native `<select>`) matching column context menu styling. SVG chevron flips when open. Current selection shown with ✓. Closes on outside click or Escape.
- ✅ Sort direction toggle (↑/↓ button) — adjacent to sort dropdown
- ✅ "Free to use only" checkbox (`nonFree` URL param)
- ✅ Date filter dropdown (`DateFilter.tsx`, ~486 lines) — radio type selection, quick-range presets, custom date pickers, blue dot indicator for active range, SVG chevron, open-state highlighting matching hover style. Maps to `since`/`until`/`takenSince`/`takenUntil`/`modifiedSince`/`modifiedUntil` URL params
- ✅ Consistent dropdown styling — all dropdowns (date picker, sort, column context menu) use shared `popup-menu`/`popup-item` CSS classes and matching `bg-grid-panel` background, `border-grid-border`, `rounded shadow-lg`. Buttons stay highlighted while open.
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints — progressive disclosure from mobile to desktop

**Routing (`TanStack Router`):**
- ✅ Zod-validated URL search params (`search-params-schema.ts`)
- ✅ Root route (`__root.tsx`) — minimal shell (bg + flex column)
- ✅ Index route (`index.tsx`) — validates params + renders SearchBar + ImageTable
- ✅ Currently at `/` not `/search` — will move when image detail route is added (see deviations.md §2)

**Keyboard navigation (matches kahuna `gu-lazy-table-shortcuts`):**
- ✅ App starts with caret in search box (`autofocus` on `<cql-input>`)
- ✅ Arrow Up/Down: scroll one row (works even when caret is in search box — keys propagate from CQL input)
- ✅ PageUp/PageDown: scroll one viewport-full of rows (dynamic — based on how many rows are currently visible, accounting for sticky header height). Partially visible rows always become fully visible on either press.
- ✅ Home: jump to top of results (works even in search box — capture-phase listener intercepts before ProseMirror editor)
- ✅ End: jump to bottom of loaded results (works even in search box). In Phase 1 (10k docs, infinite scroll) this scrolls to the bottom and triggers loadMore. In Phase 2+ (9M docs, windowed scroll) End will issue a direct ES query for the last page (`search_after` reversed or `from: total - pageSize`), replacing the data window — a seek, not a scroll.
- ✅ Two-phase keyboard handling: arrows/page keys use bubble phase (propagated from CQL input's `keysToPropagate`); Home/End use capture phase on `document` to intercept before the CQL editor's shadow DOM can consume them.

### What's Next (Phase 1 remaining)
- [ ] Column reordering via drag-and-drop (extend `column-store.ts` to persist order)
- [ ] Image detail panel / single-image view — when added, move search route from `/` to `/search` and add `/images/:imageId` route (see deviations.md §2, AGENTS.md Decision 6)
- [ ] Facet filters — dropdown/multi-select for `uploadedBy`, `usageRights.category`, `metadata.source` (use DAL `getAggregation()` for options)

### Deferred to Later Phases
- [ ] `is:GNM-owned` filter with real org config from Grid (currently recognized in CQL but not filtering)
- [ ] Windowed scroll + custom scrubber (Phase 2 — see migration-plan.md "Scrollbar & Infinite Scroll" notes)
- [ ] `GridApiDataSource` (Phase 3 — replaces ES adapter, adds auth)
- [ ] Row grouping (e.g. group by credit, source, date) — TanStack Table has built-in `getGroupedRowModel()` + `getExpandedRowModel()` with aggregation functions. Works client-side on loaded rows; for 9M-scale grouping would need server-side via ES composite/terms aggs with `manualGrouping: true`. Consider alongside facet filters.

## Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI | React 19 with TypeScript |
| Table | TanStack Table v8 (headless, virtualised, column reorder/resize) |
| Virtual Scroll | TanStack Virtual |
| State | Zustand (lightweight, URL sync middleware) |
| Routing | TanStack Router (search params validated via Zod, pairs with TanStack ecosystem) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 (utility-first, no runtime overhead, dark mode, `@layer components` for shared classes) |
| Build | Vite |
| Data Layer | Abstracted `ImageDataSource` interface — Phase 1 uses `ElasticsearchDataSource`, Phase 3+ swaps to `GridApiDataSource` |
| Validation | Zod |
| Dates | date-fns |

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Separate ES instance on port 9220** — kupua's `docker-compose.yml` is independent of Grid's. Container `kupua-elasticsearch`, cluster `kupua`, volume `kupua-es-data`. Grid's `dev/script/start.sh` won't affect it.

2. **Data Access Layer (DAL)** — TypeScript interface `ImageDataSource` with methods: `search()`, `getAggregation()`. Phase 1 implements against ES directly; Phase 3 swaps to Grid API. UI code never knows the difference.

3. **Scripts in `kupua/scripts/`** (not `kupua/dev/scripts/`) — kupua is a self-contained app; no need for Grid's layered `dev/` hierarchy.

4. **sample-data.ndjson must NOT be committed to git** — too large (115MB). Kept locally or in S3.

5. **All views are one page** — table, grid, side-by-side, detail are density levels of the same ordered list. URL reflects full state. Browser back/forward restores position.

6. **Routes match kahuna exactly** — so existing bookmarks and shared URLs work when kupua replaces kahuna:
   - `/search?query=...` — main search route with all filter params
   - `/images/:imageId?crop=...&cropType=...`
   - `/images/:imageId/crop?cropType=...`
   - `/upload`
   - `/` → redirects to `/search`

   **Complete `/search` URL params** (all optional):
   | Param | Type | Example | Notes |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `query` | string | `credit:"Getty" -by:"Foo"` | Free-text / CQL query |
   | `ids` | string | `abc123,def456` | Comma-separated image IDs (from Share button) |
   | `since` | ISO date | `2026-03-19T10:54:29.221Z` | Upload time lower bound |
   | `until` | ISO date | | Upload time upper bound |
   | `nonFree` | `true` | `true` | Show paid images (omit = free only) |
   | `payType` | string | `free\|maybe-free\|pay\|all` | Pay type filter |
   | `uploadedBy` | string | `john.doe@guardian.co.uk` | Filter by uploader |
   | `orderBy` | string | `-taken`, `-uploadTime`, `oldest` | Sort order |
   | `useAISearch` | `true` | | Enable semantic/AI search |
   | `dateField` | string | | Which date field for range |
   | `takenSince` | ISO date | | Date taken lower bound |
   | `takenUntil` | ISO date | | Date taken upper bound |
   | `modifiedSince` | ISO date | | Last modified lower bound |
   | `modifiedUntil` | ISO date | | Last modified upper bound |
   | `hasRightsAcquired` | `true\|false` | | Syndication rights filter |
   | `hasCrops` | `true\|false` | | Has exports/crops |
   | `syndicationStatus` | string | | Syndication status filter |
   | `persisted` | `true\|false` | | Is archived or has usages |
   | `expandPinboard` | string | | Pinboard integration (passthrough) |
   | `pinboardId` | string | | Pinboard integration (passthrough) |
   | `pinboardItemId` | string | | Pinboard integration (passthrough) |

   **Key mapping**: `nonFree=true` → API `free=undefined`; `hasCrops` → API `hasExports`

   Selections are NOT in URL (matching kahuna — only `ids=` from Share button).

7. **Column config in localStorage** (not URL) — visibility and widths are persisted per-client via `useColumnStore` with zustand/persist. Key: `kupua-column-config`. Column IDs use TanStack Table's format (dots→underscores). The store also holds session-only `preDoubleClickWidths` (excluded from localStorage persistence via `partialize`) for the double-click fit/restore toggle. Order and sorting will be added when needed.

8. **Scrollbar strategy** — Phase 1 uses simple infinite scroll (append pages) with the native scrollbar — sufficient for 10k docs. Phase 2 (9M docs) will switch to windowed scroll + `search_after` pagination with a custom scrubber (thumb = `windowStart / total`). Phase 6 adds sort-aware date/letter labels, smooth drag, and mobile touch. Full design notes in `kupua/exploration/docs/migration-plan.md` → "Scrollbar & Infinite Scroll — Design Notes".

9. **Local dev domain** — currently `localhost:3000`. Future: add `kupua.media.local.dev-gutools.co.uk` to `dev/nginx-mappings.yml` pointing to port 3000. Trivial change when needed.

10. **URL is single source of truth for search state** — user interactions update the URL via `useUpdateSearchParams`, which triggers `useUrlSearchSync` to push params to the Zustand store and fire a search. When clearing params (e.g. clearing the search box), all URL-managed keys are explicitly reset to `undefined` before applying URL values, so removed params don't survive in the store via spread.

11. **Sort system** — `orderBy` URL param supports comma-separated values for multi-sort (e.g. `-uploadTime,-metadata.credit`). The ES adapter's `buildSortClause` expands aliases per-part (e.g. `taken` → `metadata.dateTaken,-uploadTime`). Column headers, sort dropdown, and URL all use the same sort keys. Secondary sort is managed via shift-click.

12. **TanStack Table column ID gotcha** — when using dot-path accessors (e.g. `"metadata.credit"`), TanStack Table auto-generates column IDs with dots replaced by underscores (`"metadata_credit"`). Any map keyed by column ID must use underscores. This bit us once already.

13. **Custom URL parse/stringify (not `parseSearchWith`)** — TanStack Router's built-in `parseSearchWith` delegates to `qss.decode` which calls `toValue()`, converting `"true"` → boolean `true` and `"123"` → number `123`. Our Zod schema expects all values as strings, so booleans/numbers silently fall through `.catch(undefined)` and are lost. We use fully custom `plainParseSearch`/`plainStringifySearch` based on `URLSearchParams` directly, keeping all values as plain strings. This also avoids `JSON.stringify` wrapping strings in quotes (`%22true%22`). Stale quoted values from old bookmarks are stripped.

14. **CQL chips via `@guardian/cql` Web Component** — The `<cql-input>` custom element (from `@guardian/cql`) handles all chip rendering, editing, keyboard navigation, and typeahead. It is registered once globally in `CqlSearchInput.tsx`. The typeahead fields are built from the DAL via `typeahead-fields.ts` with resolvers that query local ES aggregations on keyword fields. When the DAL switches to the Grid API, the resolvers will automatically use live API endpoints with no UI changes needed.

15. **Mock config for Phase 1** — `kupua/exploration/mock/grid-config.conf` is a sanitised copy of PROD Grid config. `src/lib/grid-config.ts` parses it for field aliases and category lists. This avoids hardcoding and will be replaced by live config fetching in Phase 3.

16. **Start script** — `kupua/scripts/start.sh` is the single entry point for local development. It orchestrates ES startup, data loading, npm install, and Vite dev server. Flags allow skipping steps for faster restarts.

17. **`@/*` path alias** — `@/components/Foo` resolves to `src/components/Foo`. Configured in both `tsconfig.json` (`paths`) and `vite.config.ts` (`resolve.alias`). All imports use this alias.

18. **`App.tsx` deleted** — was dead code after layout moved to `routes/__root.tsx`. Removed during codebase audit.

19. **Font standardisation** — `--font-sans` is overridden in `@theme` to `'Open Sans', ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif`. This is the Tailwind 4 convention: all elements inherit from `--font-sans` via the base layer, so new elements get Open Sans automatically. Three font sizes: `text-xs` (12px) for UI chrome, `text-sm` (14px) for table cells, 13px for CQL input (Web Component theme). No arbitrary sizes.

20. **Shared popup styling via CSS component classes** — `popup-menu` and `popup-item` are defined in `index.css` `@layer components`. All dropdowns and context menus use these classes for consistent appearance (`bg-grid-panel`, `border-grid-border`, `rounded shadow-lg`, hover highlight). New menus inherit the look automatically.

21. **Auto-reveal hidden columns on sort** — when the user sorts by a column that's currently hidden, the column is automatically shown via `toggleVisibility()` (same store action as the context menu), so it persists as a normal user choice. The user can hide it again anytime. Generic — works for any sortable column, not just specific ones.

## Kahuna Reference

The existing frontend lives at `kahuna/`. Key files to understand:
- `kahuna/public/js/main.js` — AngularJS app bootstrap, routing, config
