/**
 * Search route — the main search page at `/search`.
 *
 * URL search params are validated with Zod and synced to the Zustand search store.
 * The URL is the source of truth: changing the URL triggers a search,
 * and user interactions (typing, selecting filters) update the URL.
 *
 * When `image` is present in the URL, the image detail overlay is shown
 * on top of the search results. The list view (table or grid) stays mounted
 * (hidden) so scroll position, virtualizer state, and search context are
 * all preserved. Browser back removes `image` and the view is exactly
 * where you left it.
 *
 * The `density` param switches between grid (default) and table views. Both share
 * the same data layer (`useDataWindow`), focus, and search context.
