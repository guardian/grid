**Grid** is [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/)â€™s new **image
management system**, which provides a **universal** and **fast**
experience accessing media that is **organised** and using it in an
**affordable** way to produce **high-quality** content.

See the [Vision](VISION.md) document for more details on the core
principles behind this project.

Grid runs as a set of independent micro-services
([Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and
[Play Framework](https://playframework.com/)) exposed as hypermedia
APIs ([argo](https://github.com/argo-rest/spec)) and accessed using a
rich Web user interface ([AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)).

Grid relies on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for
blazing-fast searching, and AWS services as additional storage and
communication mechanisms.


Running the applications
------------------------

### Requirements

You will need to install:

* sbt
* JDK 8
* Nginx
* [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)
`sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick` or `brew install graphicsmagick --with-little-cms2`.
* [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)


### Nginx

To run correctly in standalone mode we run behind nginx, this can be installed as follows:

1. Install nginx:
  * *Linux:*   ```sudo apt-get install nginx```
  * *Mac OSX:* ```brew install nginx```

2. Make sure you have a sites-enabled folder under your nginx home. This should be
  * *Linux:* ```/etc/nginx/sites-enabled```
  * *Mac OSX:* ```/usr/local/etc/nginx/```

3. Make sure your nginx.conf (found in your nginx home) contains the following line in the http{} block:
`include sites-enabled/*;`
  * you may also want to disable the default server on 8080

4. Get the [dev-nginx](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx) repo checked out on your machine

5. [Set up certs](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx#install-ssl-certificates) if you've not already done so

6. Configure the app routes in nginx

    sudo <path_of_dev-nginx>/setup-app.rb <path_of_media_service_repo>/nginx-mapping.yml

### Elasticsearch

You can run `setup.sh` to install and start Elasticsearch.  You can use
the script to start up Elasticsearch even if it's already installed.

Alternatively you can do these steps manually:

Run the Elasticsearch installer from the `elasticsearch` directory:

        $ cd elasticsearch/
        $ ./dev-install.sh

Start Elasticsearch from the `elasticsearch` directory:

        $ cd elasticsearch/
        $ ./dev-start.sh

### Create CloudFormation Stack

First you need to create some dev credentials in AWS - ask your friendly system administrator.

**Pro-tip**: Set `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` to avoid using the `--profile` flag with the awscli in the future.

```sh
echo 'export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=media-service' >> $HOME/.profile
```

To create your stack run [create-dev-stack.sh](cloud-formation/scripts/create-dev-stack.sh):

```sh
cd cloud-formation/scripts
./create-dev-stack.sh
```

** The create-dev-stack script will use your default aws profile **

### Generate .properties files

Generate your .properties files for the various media-service services using the
[dot-properties generator](./docker/configs/generators/README.md)

This will also create a ```panda.properties``` file that configures the
[pan-domain authentication](https://github.com/guardian/pan-domain-authentication)

This file will be used by the different applications to share auth
config, so that CORS is enabled across APIs.

Make sure you put the generated ```.properties``` files in
```/etc/gu/``` instead of ```~/.gu/``` as many apps do.


### Run the services
There are a few different ways to run the services, please see [here](./docs/running.md).

## NGINX, Play & SNI

As the Play Framework does not yet support [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) NGINX can't always work out which certificate to send where there are multiple services on the same IP. This might result in NGINX sending the incorrect certificate. This will result in a `HostnameVerifier Exception` appearing in application logs.

# Resolution

When the correct cert to send is ambiguous NGINX simply sends the first cert it sees in it's configuration (which is loaded from config files in alphabetical order) to resolve this problem, prefix your grid config filename with `0-`!


## GraphicsMagick && Little CMS 2

If you get a permissions issue when running
``` brew install graphicsmagick --with-little-cms2 ```
you can install little cms (``` brew install little-cms2 ``` )
and then compile graphicsmagick from source, it will automatically pick up on the little cms installation
