Grid
====

**Grid** is [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/)â€™s new **image
management system**, which provides a **universal** and **fast**
experience accessing media that is **organised** and using it in an
**affordable** way to produce **high-quality** content.

See the [Vision](VISION.md) document for more details on the core
principles behind this project.

![Screenshot of Grid search](docs/images/screenshot-2015-07-03T11:34:43.jpg)

Grid runs as a set of independent micro-services
([Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and
[Play Framework](https://playframework.com/)) exposed as hypermedia
APIs ([argo](https://github.com/argo-rest/spec)) and accessed using a
rich Web user interface ([AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)).

Grid relies on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for
blazing-fast searching, and AWS services as additional storage and
communication mechanisms.


Running the applications
------------------------

### Requirements

You will need to install:

* sbt
* JDK 8
* Nginx
* [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)
`sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick` or `brew install graphicsmagick`.

### Nginx

To run correctly in standalone mode we run behind nginx, this can be installed as follows:

1. Install nginx:
  * *Linux:*   ```sudo apt-get install nginx```
  * *Mac OSX:* ```brew install nginx```

2. Make sure you have a sites-enabled folder under your nginx home. This should be
  * *Linux:* ```/etc/nginx/sites-enabled```
  * *Mac OSX:* ```/usr/local/etc/nginx/```

3. Make sure your nginx.conf (found in your nginx home) contains the following line in the http{} block:
`include sites-enabled/*;`
  * you may also want to disable the default server on 8080

4. Get the [dev-nginx](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx) repo checked out on your machine

5. [Set up certs](https://github.com/guardian/dev-nginx#install-ssl-certificates) if you've not already done so

6. Configure the app routes in nginx

    sudo <path_of_dev-nginx>/setup-app.rb <path_of_media_service_repo>/nginx-mapping.yml

### Elasticsearch

You can run `setup.sh` to install and start Elasticsearch.  You can use
the script to start up Elasticsearch even if it's already installed.

Alternatively you can do these steps manually:

Run the Elasticsearch installer from the `elasticsearch` directory:

        $ cd elasticsearch/
        $ ./dev-install.sh

Start Elasticsearch from the `elasticsearch` directory:

        $ cd elasticsearch/
        $ ./dev-start.sh

### Create CloudFormation Stack

First you need to create some dev credentials and resources in AWS.

Log into the AWS Console (ask your friendly system administrator for a
link and credentials) and change to the EU (Ireland) availability zone.

Go to the CloudFormation console and add a new stack, call it
`media-service-DEV-{your-username}`, upload the template file from
`cloud-formation/dev-template.json` and create the stack.

### .properties files

Generate your .properties files for the various media-service services using the
[dot-properties generator](scripts/dot-properties)

This will also create a ```panda.properties``` file that configures the
[pan-domain authentication](https://github.com/guardian/pan-domain-authentication)

This file will be used by the different applications to share auth
config, so that CORS is enabled across APIs.

Make sure you put the generated ```.properties``` files in
```/etc/gu/``` instead of ```~/.gu/``` as many apps do.

### Run Media API

From the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt
        > project media-api
        > run

You may pass an argument to `run` to define which port to attach to, e.g.:

        > run 9001

The media api should be up at
[http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/).


### Run Thrall

From the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt
        > project thrall
        > run 9002

The thrall should be up at
[http://localhost:9002/](http://localhost:9002/).


### Run the Image Loader

From the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt
        > project image-loader
        > run 9003

The image loader should be up at
[http://localhost:9003/](http://localhost:9003/).

You can upload a test image to it using `curl`:

```
curl -X POST --data-binary @integration/src/test/resources/images/honeybee.jpg http://localhost:9003/images
```

It should then appear in the Media API at [http://localhost:9001/images](http://localhost:9001/images).


### Run the FTP Watcher

From the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt -Dftp.active=true
        > project ftp-watcher
        > run 9004

The FTP watcher should be up at
[http://localhost:9004/](http://localhost:9004/).

Images should appear in the Media API at [http://localhost:9001/images](http://localhost:9001/images).


### Run Kahuna

Run the `setup.sh` script from the kahuna directory to get started:

        $ cd kahuna
        $ ./setup.sh

Then, from the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt
        > project kahuna
        > run 9005

The user interface should be up at
[http://localhost:9005/](http://localhost:9005/).


### Run Cropper

Add an API key for cropper to your key bucket:

```
# Create key file
$ CROPPER_KEY=cropper-`head -c 1024 /dev/urandom | md5sum | awk '{ print $1 }'`
$ echo Cropper > $CROPPER_KEY

# Upload to S3
# note: see `aws --profile media s3 ls | grep keybucket` output to find your bucket name
$ aws s3 cp $CROPPER_KEY s3://...YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.../
```

From the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt
        > project cropper
        > run 9006

The user interface should be up at
[http://localhost:9006/](http://localhost:9006/).


### Run Metadata Editor

From the project root, run via sbt:

        $ sbt
        > project metadata-editor
        > run 9007

The user interface should be up at
[http://localhost:9007/](http://localhost:9007/).


### [Run ImgOps](imgops/README.md)


## Troubleshooting

### Nginx returns "413 Request Entity Too Large"

Make sure you bump the maximum allowed body size in your nginx config (defaults to 1MB):

```
client_max_body_size 20m;
```

### Crops fail with a 500 HTTP error and an SSL error in the cropper logs

Make sure you install any certificate authority file needed in the
Java runtime for the cropper service to talk to the media-api.

You can do so with the `keytool` command:

```
$ sudo keytool -import \
               -trustcacerts \
               -alias internalrootca \
               -file rootcafile.cer \
               -keystore /path/to/global/jre/lib/security/cacerts
```

where `internalrootca` is the name you want to give the certificate in
your keystore, `rootcafile.cer` is the certificate file you want to
install, and `/path/to/global/jre/lib/security/cacerts` the location
of the `cacerts` file for the JRE you're using.

On Mac OS X, it may be something like
`/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts`;
on GNU Linux, it may be something like
`/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/cacerts`.
